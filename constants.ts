        title: "What is Babu Culture?",
        paragraphs: [
            "We are approaching our 80th year of Independence from the British rule which in itself was characterized by inequality and injustice. Nevertheless, even during the colonial era we saw a few instances of native Indians rising to respectable positions within the political administration of the time. From the creation of the Indian Civil Services in 1853 to today when it is now called the Union Public Service Commission or UPSC.",
            "But why is that relevant? Well it was during the colonial era that some Indian administrative officials came to be known as “Babus”. Although these individuals lacked any real autonomy, they still came to be respected by the Indian masses due to their post and education. Today these “Babus” have devolved into corrupt officers that exist and thrive within our contemporary administrative system."

        title: "Does that imply that the Framework itself is Corrupt?",
        paragraphs: [
            "If we believe reports then almost 25% or more civil servants are corrupt or incompetent in serving the common man. Remember when recently the Election Commission duties were going on, we saw all that drama came under fire for biasness or ill practices? Or the raids conducted on IAS and IPS officers’ government bungalows in Chhattisgarh where 570 crore cash was found? Just last month (September, 2025) 1.70 crore was found from a young civil servant’s house. These are not isolated cases; there are many more like them.",
            "The problem here is not just this culture of corruption but also our feeble attention span comparable to that of a goldfish. We waste time on useless reels and random content, but when it comes to real issues we ignore them."

        title: "A new and emerging issue - Misuse of PR Teams",
        paragraphs: [
            "Before going any further let’s clarify what a civil servant actually is. By definition, a civil servant is a person who works in public or administrative service. However, today our officers are deluded into thinking that this definition only applies before joining the service.",
            "For example, the SP of a district is supposed to maintain law and order, investigate crimes properly, and keep good relation between public and police, but in Chhattisgarh, IPS Dr. Abhishek Pallav, who is now posted in Raipur, is more busy catching bikers without helmets and making them stand in front of camera for public shaming.",
            "That in itself is not an issue at all and rather commendable to be properly implementing traffic regulations, but if we check Raipur’s crime graph, the city stands 4th in crime rate in India. More than 6,920 cases of crime against women are pending. In 2024 Raipur was even called a “murder spree city”. That shows the law and order is still weak. When major cases are pending should they not take priority over public shaming of bikers without helmet over social media?",

        title: "But is that all?",
        paragraphs: [
            "If we see the problems of grassroots bureaucracy from the perspective of an IPS or IAS officer, the picture is really complex. The biggest problem for officers is the gap in selection and training. Even today, many people just clear the exam and come in, but they lack ground-level honesty, citizen empathy, and practical problem-solving skills, which are the most important for daily governance.",
            "Then there is the digital and transparency gap. In some districts, work is still on paper, and online tracking systems are either partial or outdated, creating delays and loopholes for corruption. Public pressure and accountability is also a big issue. People complain, but follow-up hardly happens, giving grassroots officials chances for short term gains or nepotism.",
            "Workload is another massive challenge. One patwari or clerk has to manage multiple schemes, certificates, land records, and grievance redressals for a whole village, which increases stress and inefficiency.",
            "Another issue as already discussed is the PR and camera obsession of some civil servants. Officers are spending more time on public image, viral raids, or camera stunts instead of focusing on real issues like public welfare, crime control, and honest governance. This creates a culture where style is valued over substance."

        title: "How can we mitigate these challenges?",
        paragraphs: [
            "If officers see this systemically, the solution is simple: selection should include integrity and psychometric tests, there should be continuous training and mentorship, digital logs and citizen feedback must be implemented, proper system of incentives and penalties should exist, and PR obsession should be controlled. Only these measures can cut the flow of grassroots corruption and inefficiency, and make bureaucracy efficient, accountable, and citizen-friendly."
